Winter Storm Sweeps Across the Midwest, Disrupting Holiday Travel
A powerful winter storm is sweeping across the Midwest this week, bringing heavy snow, icy roads, and flight cancellations just days before the Christmas holiday.

Meteorologists report that some areas could see up to 12 inches of snow by Tuesday morning, with wind gusts exceeding 40 mph creating dangerous whiteout conditions. The National Weather Service has issued blizzard warnings for parts of Iowa, Illinois, and Wisconsin.

Airlines have already canceled more than 1,200 flights nationwide, with Chicago O’Hare and Minneapolis–St. Paul airports among the hardest hit. Authorities are urging travelers to check flight statuses before heading to the airport and to prepare for possible delays.

State transportation departments are warning drivers to avoid unnecessary travel, as icy highways have already caused multiple accidents. Emergency crews are on standby to assist stranded motorists.

“If you can stay home, please do so,” said Wisconsin Governor Laura Mitchell. “Your safety is more important than any holiday schedule.”

The storm is expected to move eastward by midweek, potentially affecting the Great Lakes region and parts of the Northeast
